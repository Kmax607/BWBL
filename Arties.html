        <h1>Artie’s Power Rankings</h1>

        <p><strong>Thursday, August 8, 2024</strong></p>
        <p><strong>8. Venom Vipers – 0-20</strong></p>
        <p>The Vipers season is over. They ended up not winning a game, but hopefully they had fun. They did show improvement overall, and if they can learn how to effectively pitch and stick with it, I think they will be better later on down the line.</p>

        <p><strong>7. Diamond Dogs – 6-14</strong></p>
        <p>The Dogs' collapse has come full circle. After a promising first half of the season, they have finished with a record of 3-7 in their last ten games.</p>

        <p><strong>6. Bases Loaded – 7-13</strong></p>
        <p>The usually completely overlooked Bases Loaded has stormed back into the rankings, moving up to #6. Even though Loaded didn’t reach the playoffs, I feel like they always had fun and played everyone fairly hard. All Sickle needs is a good arm or two, and they will be in the mix for playoffs next season, as they’ve always had the bats.</p>

        <p><strong>5. Moonshots – 10-10</strong></p>
        <p>Moonshots got a break the last week of the season by receiving two forfeit wins against the Dogs. That gives them some extra time to get even more healthy as we all got to enjoy Hannon as the special umpire for the last week of the season (99% umpire rating in my book). We'll see if they are healthy enough to beat 1776 in a one-game series, and take on Roadkill directly after.</p>

        <p><strong>4. Kings of the North – 14-6</strong></p>
        <p>After being at the top of my rankings for the majority of the season, Kings slip a few spots due to recent performances. They’ll need to bounce back in the playoffs to prove they belong at the top.</p>

        <p><strong>3. 1776 – 14-6</strong></p>
        <p>Though '76 falls into the unlucky #4 spot going into the playoffs, it seems as though they are starting to click. They swept a very good Roadkill team this past weekend to finish up the season as Dougher collected his 600th strikeout, and Artim his 700th strikeout, respectively. Sweeping Roadkill with their top 2 arms may be a big momentum boost for '76 and a matchup next weekend could come to fruition. However, a one-game playoff with Caladie and the Moonshots awaits them before they can even think about the next series.</p>

        <p><strong>2. Scared Hitless – 14-6</strong></p>
        <p>I told you last week Hitless may be primed for a deep run. They split with Roadkill to end their season, which could be a huge momentum boost for them. Hitless squeaked by '76 for the 3 seed, but jump up to #2 with their wins this weekend. As I stated before, their offense has been more alive this year which could play a key factor in them making it to the championship series as they find themselves in a 3-game playoff with Kings this upcoming weekend.</p>

        <p><strong>1. Roadkill – 15-5</strong></p>
        <p>When Roadkill started the day on Sunday, I feel like they had aspirations of winning all 4 games they played and going 18-2 on the year. '76 shut that down with a sweep, and they went on the split against Hitless in a meaningless last game for them. They end the regular season as the number one seed and rightfully so. They can hit, and they can pitch, and they can field. There isn’t much more they need to do. They’ll have a matchup with either 1776 or Moonshots this Sunday with the winner heading to the Red Robin Cup.</p>

        <hr>

        <p><strong>Thursday, August 1, 2024</strong></p>
        <p><strong>8. Venom Vipers – 0-16</strong></p>
        <p>They faced the powerhouse of the Roadkill squad this past weekend and let's just say it ended rather quickly. They aren't yet going to compete with a team that has championship aspirations as high as Roadkill does. On the bright side, they will finish the whole year seemingly just happy to be out there playing ball, which is what it is all about.</p>

        <p><strong>7. Bases Loaded – 3-13</strong></p>
        <p>Loaded had their full complement of players this past weekend with 8! And it showed as they split with the Diamond Dogs, playing spoiler and just about ending the Dogs chances of making it into the playoffs. Kenny Kandrac looked good on the mound, only giving up 4 runs to a squad that normally hits the ball well. Loaded will finish up the season against the Vipers where they look to sweep and continue their winning ways into the offseason.</p>

        <p><strong>6. Diamond Dogs – 6-12</strong></p>
        <p>The Dog’s playoff contention looks to be over, as they battled up to the end of the season. For only having 3 guys most of the second half of the season, they fared alright, as it’s tough to do. On the bright side, Sliker looks as if he’s figured it out offensively, and if he can work on his pitching (10.00 ERA in 25 innings), he could be a bright spot for someone next season.</p>

        <p><strong>5. Moonshots – 8-10</strong></p>
        <p>Moonshots picked up a much-needed split against 1776 on Sunday. They were still missing their second-best arm in Cinti, but they squeaked out a split with Brett on the mound in a 1-0 game. Maybe they are finally getting healthy for a playoff push? I guess time will tell as they are all but locked into playoffs into the 5 seed.</p>

        <p><strong>4. 1776 – 12-6</strong></p>
        <p>76 tried for a sweep against the Moonshots, but ultimately split in a very well-played series on both sides. I still think Auggie will be a key part of a deep playoff run, as 76 does have a very good 1-2 punch in pitching and Dougher looks to be smashing the ball on the offensive side at the right time of the season. They still do have a shot at the apparently coveted #3 seed IF they can sweep Roadkill, and Roadkill sweeps Hitless on Sunday. Either way, they are locked into the playoffs.</p>

        <p><strong>3. Kings of the North – 14-6</strong></p>
        <p>Kings finally played the American Division the last couple of weeks of the season and lost both series. Although the series against Hitless could’ve had a better outcome (I saw you drop that ball on purpose with 2 outs in the 5th Dalton), but I digress. It appears a championship run may be hanging in the balance that first week of playoffs as their two top arms in Dotzel and Fuchylo will not be there. No matter who Kings plays, they will have to hit the ball and hopefully Shearer and Hart can hold back whoever they play in the playoffs.</p>

        <p><strong>2. Scared Hitless – 13-5</strong></p>
        <p>They are peaking at the right time of the year. Nick looks like Nick should look pitching and Josh is a good #2. They have a lot of quality wins as their record indicates, though I feel like they should’ve lost one against the Kings. They finish up against Roadkill after 76 and Roadkill play. If 76 loses one, they are the 3 seed, and if Roadkill wins one, Hitless stays the 2 seed. A lot can happen this Sunday to determine seeding, but it is certain they will be in the playoffs.</p>

        <p><strong>1. Roadkill – 14-4</strong></p>
        <p>After splitting with Hitless last weekend, Roadkill stays in the top spot in the rankings. Sunday will be another challenge for them as they will have to face 76 and Hitless all in one day. We will know the seeding at the end of Sunday, but if Roadkill wins 3 of 4, they will be the #1 seed. It should be a good weekend, and I am sure Roadkill has all intentions of sweeping through and getting that #1 seed.</p><br>
