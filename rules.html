            <h2><em>I. Fun</em></h2>
            <p>
                <strong>A.</strong> Fun is the name of the game. If you cannot have fun, you can’t be in the Backyard Wiffle Ball League.<br>
                <strong>B.</strong> There are winners and there are teams who don’t win (some may deem them losers) in each game. If you win, win with dignity. If you lose, lose with respect for the victors.<br>
                <strong>C.</strong> As in hockey and Little League, handshakes are expected following each and every game. Although, not required, it is simply good sportsmanship that promotes having fun!
            </p>

            <h2><em>II. Field Requirements</em></h2>
            <p>
                <strong>A.</strong> The playing field has some essential requirements that follow, but as long as these basics are followed, “quirks” are allowed (and actually encouraged) in order to promote variety.<br>
                <strong>B.</strong> The infield must be a 45 foot square. The outfield will extend to at least 75 feet down the lines from home plate to the fence in both left and right fields, with no maximum. Center field will extend to at least 100 feet from home plate, with no maximum. The outfield wall must be at least three (3) feet in height, with the maximum being 15 feet.<br>

            <h2><em>III. Equipment</em></h2>
            <p>
                <strong>A.</strong> The official ball of the Backyard Wiffle Ball League is that which is manufactured by The Wiffle Ball Inc.
                <strong>B.</strong> Balls can be scuffed in any way, unless deemed by the umpire or a present Council member to have affected the integrity of the ball. No foreign materials may be placed on the ball. If foreign materials become stuck to the ball, the ball will be removed from play.<br>
                <strong>C.</strong> Any ball that is cracked to the middle seam or has a 1/4” or more crack will be declared unplayable and removed from play. This will prevent unorthodox movement of the ball.<br>
                <strong>D.</strong> No player is permitted to wear a glove on the field at any time other than batting gloves while batting.<br>
                <strong>E.</strong> The bats that are to be used in the Backyard Wiffle Ball League are the yellow Wiffle® ball bat; the Loco Bat; the WhatABat; the Nerf bat; the Blitzball bat; the Louisville Slugger bat; the Moonshot bat. Other bats may be approved by the League Council.<br>
                <ol>
                <li> Tape may be used to decorate the bat, but may not add any significant weight to the bat.  Paint cannot be added to the barrel of any bat. Any judgment calls will be made by the League Council.</li>
                <li> All bats are subject to inspection by the League Council before play begins. If the bat is deemed illegal, it will be removed from play.</li>
                </ol>

            <h2><em>IV. Umpiring</em></h2>
            <p>
                <strong>A.</strong> Umpires <br>
                <ol>
                <li> Two umpires will be appointed per game.  Block umpiring will be used (ex. Series 1 teams must provide one umpire each for Series 2 and vice versa.  If there is an odd number of series, the last series will be umpired by volunteers.)</li>
                <strong>a.</strong> The umpire is responsible for the interpretation of all of the rules, as well as to make any decision on rules not specifically outlined within this rulebook.  In the event of a disputed call, the umpires will confer with all available non-playing Council members to discuss the call.  The captains involved in the call will be brought in if Council deems it necessary.<br>
                <strong>b.</strong> The umpire is responsible for monitoring the speed limit (please see Section IV-B-8).<br>
                <strong>c.</strong> Penalty for not providing an umpire as outlined in IV.A.1 is that, for their first series the following week, the opposing team may choose one player that must sit out a game, but it must be a different player for each game of the double-header if multiple games were missed the previous week.  This can compound with Rule X.H.1.<br>
                <li> The umpires decision is final. Players may be ejected from the game by the umpire and face other action by the League Council. This includes incidents of arguing calls or due to inappropriate conduct.</li>
                </ol>
                <strong>B.</strong> Strikes and Balls <br>
                <ol>
                <li> The count will consist of four (4) balls and three (3) strikes.  Four balls is a walk and three strikes is a strikeout.</li>
                <li> All balls and strikes will be determined by the backstop.  If a pitched ball hits the slab or any surrounding pipes (excluding the legs/post) before hitting the ground, it will be called a strike.</li>
                <li> If the batter hits a foul ball with two strikes and the ball hits the strike zone, the batter will be charged with a strikeout.</li>
                <li> Any pitched ball that does not hit the strike zone is considered a ball unless swung at.</li>
                <li> If a batter is hit by a pitch, it is not a base on balls, but simply one ball added to the count.</li>
                <li> Batter interference will be called and a strike recorded if the batter moves into the path of a
                pitched ball.  While in the batter’s box, the batter may not stand in a way that a part of his body covers
                the strike zone and prohibits the pitcher from being able to hit the strike zone with a straight pitch. If the
                pitcher feels a batter is covering the strike zone, it will be up to the discretion of the umpire to decide if
                the batter needs to move back in the box.</li>
                <li> All check swing calls will be the responsibility of the umpire.</li>
                <li> The speed limit is 70 MPH. No warnings will be issued. If a pitch goes above said limit:</li>
                    <strong>a.</strong> any contact other than a foul-tip hitting the zone with two strikes counts.<br>
                    <strong>b.</strong> foul-tip hitting the zone with two strikes is treated as a foul ball.<br>
                    <strong>c.</strong> no contact of any kind results in a ball.<br>
                </ol>
                <strong>C.</strong> Fair and Foul
                <ol>
                <li> All fair and foul calls will be the responsibility of the umpire.</li>
                <li> Any ball not reaching the arc outlined in Rule II-E at home plate is a foul ball.</li>
                <li> There is no limit to the number of foul balls with two strikes.</li>
                </ol>
                <strong>D.</strong> Ground Rules
                <ol>
                1. Any ball that is fair and then rolls past the imaginary line as if the outfield fence extended forever will be
                ruled a ground rule double.
                2. Any ball that, on the fly, hits any part of a flag or flag pole on the left field wall is a home run.
                3. Out of play territory – main field
                a. The area behind both dugouts consisting of the gap between the back of the dugout walls and the chain link fence.
                b. On either base line, the opening between the chain link fence and the front corner of the dugout. If the ball crosses this imaginary line or enters the dugout, the ball is considered out of play.
                c. The area in foul territory that extends past the outfield fence, as if the outfield fence were to continue on forever.
                d. For any field other than the main, out of play territory should be established and understood by captains prior to the start of the game.
                e. If a ball is hit into out of play territory, it is dead and is considered a foul ball regardless of whether it is caught by a fielder.
                f. If a ball is thrown into out of play territory by a fielder, the following applies:
                1. A+ny baserunner who at the time the fielder threw the ball was running towards a base (this includes the batter running to first base) will be awarded the base they were                                                attempting to reach PLUS one additional base.
                2. Any baserunner who at the time the fielder threw the ball was either stationery or retreating back to their bag will be awarded one base.
                E. The umpire is responsible for maintaining the count and the number of outs in the inning. It is not required to declare the count and outs after every pitch, but they must be declared upon request.
                F. The official score will be kept by the scorekeeper or batting team and is to be declared after every half-inning and upon request.
